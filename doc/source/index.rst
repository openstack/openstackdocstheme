 OpenStack Sphinx themes
=========================

*openstackdocstheme* is a Sphinx documentation extension that includes
theme support for OpenStack Foundation projects.

The *openstackdocs* theme is used for documentation that is published
to docs.openstack.org and developer.openstack.org. It is intended for
use by OpenStack `projects governed by the Technical Committee`_.

The *starlingxdocs* theme is used for documentation that is published
to docs.starlingx.io. It is intended for use by StarlingX
`projects governed by the Technical Steering Committee`_.

Using the theme
---------------

.. note::

   Prior to using this theme, ensure your project can use the OpenStack brand
   by referring to the brand guidelines at https://www.openstack.org/brand.

.. note::

   Some of the settings below are included in the file generated by Sphinx when
   you initialize a project, so they may already have values that need to be
   changed.

#. Update the requirements list for your project to include
   ``openstackdocstheme`` (usually in ``test-requirements.txt``).

#. If your project previously used the *oslosphinx* theme (without modifying
   the header navigation), remove ``oslosphinx`` from your requirements list,
   and then in your ``conf.py`` you can remove the import statement and
   extension listing for *oslosphinx*.

#. Once done, you should add ``'openstackdocstheme'`` to the list of extensions
   Sphinx needs to initialize and configure the theme::

     extensions = [
         # ...
         'openstackdocstheme',
         # ...
     ]

     html_theme = 'openstackdocs'

#. Set the options to link to the git repository on
   ``https://opendev.org`` and bug tracker.

   ``repository_name``
       The prefix and repo name. For example,
       ``'openstack/python-glanceclient'``.

   ``use_storyboard``
       Set to ``True`` if using StoryBoard.

       .. note::

          If using StoryBoard, do not set ``bug_project`` and ``bug_tag``
          options.

   ``bug_project``
       The project name or ID. For launchpad, it's a string like
       ``python-glanceclient``. If unspecified, the "Report a bug"
       links are not shown. This option can be removed if using StoryBoard.

   ``bug_tag``
      Launchpad bug tag. If unspecified, no tag is set. The default is empty.
      This option can be removed if using StoryBoard.

   One example for a project using launchpad::

      # openstackdocstheme options
      repository_name = 'openstack/python-glanceclient'
      bug_project = 'python-glanceclient'
      bug_tag = ''

   One example for a project using StoryBoard::

      # openstackdocstheme options
      repository_name = 'openstack/infra-manual'
      use_storyboard = True

#. Remove the options that will be automatically configured by the theme.

   - ``project``
   - ``html_last_updated_fmt``
   - ``latex_engine``
   - ``latex_elements``

   In addition, if your documentation is versioned, you should remove the
   options related to versioning.

   - ``version``
   - ``release``

.. versionchanged:: 1.20

   In older versions of *openstackdocstheme*, it was necessary to manually
   configure the ``html_last_updated_fmt`` option for HTML output and the
   ``latex_engine`` and ``latex_elements`` options if you required PDF output.
   This is no longer the case as these attributes are now configured
   automatically.


Additional Configuration
------------------------

If you are using this theme for API reference documentation, set the sidebar
navigation in the ``html_theme_options`` in the ``conf.py`` file::

    # To use the API Reference sidebar dropdown menu,
    # uncomment the html_theme_options parameter.  The theme
    # variable, sidebar_dropdown, should be set to `api_ref`.
    # Otherwise, the list of links for the User and Ops docs
    # appear in the sidebar dropdown menu.
    html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "sidebar_dropdown": "api_ref",
        "sidebar_mode": "toc",
        # ...
    }

If you are using this theme for documentation you want to release based on git
tags on your repository, set the release dropdown menu option in the
``html_theme_options`` in the ``conf.py`` file. By default it is set to
``False``::

    html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "show_other_versions": "True",
        # ...
    }

If you are using this theme for a project with published documentation that
predates the Mitaka release cycle, set the earliest published version in the
``html_theme_options`` in the ``conf.py`` file to the name of the first series
with documentation available. By default it is set to ``None``::

    html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "earliest_published_series": "grizzly",
        # ...
    }

.. warning::

    Do not use this for release-notes as they are always published as one
    document with internal versioning.


A badge pointing out the support status of a document is shown now
for repositories that have ``stable/`` branches. The badge is not
displayed for api-ref, api-guide and releasenotes documents. It
can be disabled with the ``display_badge`` html theme option::

        html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "display_badge": False,
        # ...
    }

The TOC on the left contains a global section (to navigate between pages)
and a local section (showing page contents). If the TOC is displayed in the
text, you might want to disable the global section of the TOC::

    html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "display_global_toc_section": False,
        # ...
    }

If you are using this theme for something other than docs.openstack.org,
you can customize the root title ("OpenStack Docs") that appears in the
page title and the left arrow tooltip::

    html_theme_options = {
        # ...
        "root_title": "OpenStack Governance",
        # ...
    }

External Link Helper
--------------------

The configuration option ``openstack_projects`` can be used to define
custom roles that build links that update automatically when branches
are created for each release series. Builds on the master branch link
to the ``latest`` documentation.

In the ``conf.py`` for the source documentation, add:

.. code-block:: python

   openstack_projects = ['horizon']

Then in the documentation source, link to a target using syntax like:

.. code-block:: rst

   :horizon-doc:`Launching Instances with Horizon <user/launch-instances.html>`

.. note::

   Do not use this feature to reference projects that have a different branching
   policy, for example, only have a master branch.


Demonstration example
---------------------

The demo documentation provides example output to ensure it matches what's
expected. The link below points to the example output when using the theme
for all documentation that is not API reference.
